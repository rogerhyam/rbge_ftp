    <!-- full description -->
    <dc:description>The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh was established in 1670 and during the 20th century acquired three Regional Gardens – the mountainous Benmore in Argyll; Dawyck in the wooded hills of the Scottish Borders and Logan on the Gulf Stream-warmed southern peninsula of Dumfries &amp; Galloway.
        Together they represent one of the world’s largest living collections of plants.
